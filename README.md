# video-book

This is a sample repository for creating ebooks with videos using Markdown.

Compile using pandoc:
```
pandoc mybook.md -o mybook.epub
```

Additional sizing constraints can be applied using HTML5 video notation instead of the Markdown shortcut.

The compiled ebook was tested in Starrea which displays the video perfectly fine.
